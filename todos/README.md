## Task Management Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase
- Define clear acceptance criteria
- Estimate complexity and effort
- Identify dependencies
- Add to appropriate milestone

### 2. Development Phase
- Create feature branch
- Implement according to specifications
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation

### 3. Review Phase
- Code review and feedback
- Testing validation
- Documentation review
- Performance assessment

### 4. Completion Phase
- Merge to main branch
- Update implementation status
- Mark task as complete
- Plan next iteration

## Priority Levels

- **P0 (Critical)**: Blocking issues, security vulnerabilities
- **P1 (High)**: Core functionality, major features
- **P2 (Medium)**: Enhancements, optimizations
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice-to-have features, future improvements

## Progress Tracking

Use the following format for task updates:

```markdown
## Task: [Task Name]
- **Status**: In Progress | Completed | Blocked
- **Assignee**: [Name]
- **Priority**: P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
- **Due Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Progress**: [Description of current progress]
- **Blockers**: [Any blocking issues]
- **Next Steps**: [What needs to be done next]
```
